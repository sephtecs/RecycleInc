Recycl-inc is a website designed for people to easily access information regarding what materials are recyclable and the locations to recycle at.

The beta version of the website only consists of showing multiple recycling locations around your location or whatever location you type into the search bar, allows website visitors to create accounts that later will be their own personal dashboards with saved locations that they can easily access with personal notes.

The website will be aiming to educate people further about what recycling, hazardous materials, and e-waste is and the effects they have on the environment with different links, articles, images and videos that will be easy to read.


The technologies that we have implemented so far consist of Google Maps API.
